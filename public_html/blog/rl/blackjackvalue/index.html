    <h1>The Value Of a Blackjack Strategy</h1>

    <p>
      Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning textbook describes a simplified
      Blackjack game. If we pick a strategy for blackjack, 
      how good is it to be in each state of the decision space.
    </p>

    <h2>Decision Space</h2>

    <img alt="Mangelbrot" src="/blog/images/bj.jpg"
								class="img-responsive">

    <p>
      The state representation captures the players total, the dealer's showing card and if the
      players hand has a useable ace. If the player total is less than 12, it makes sense to always hit
      so there is no decision to be made. This means the player total can take on values from 12 to 21.
      The dealers showing card can be a number from 1 to 10. A useable ace is captured as a boolean. 
    </p>

    <p>
      [[12-21], [1-10], [true, false]]: 200 states
    </p>

    <p>
      The reward is 1 for a win, 0 for a draw and -1 for a loss. This is an undiscounted reward model
      where reward during an episode is 0 and only the final reward is counted. This means that we are
      taking the terminal reward and adding it to the average for each state.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dealer hits up to a total of 16.
    </p>

    <h2>
      State Value Visualization
    </h2>

    <p>
      What is the value of a state with the given reward structure.
      This table shows the average reward that is achieved in each state. 
      Each cell ranges from -1 to 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are going to generate episodes and observe the reward. For each state
      encountered we are going to add the observed reward to average reward value
      of the state.
    </p>

    <p>
      Example: Given a strategy of "hit on 19"
    </p>

    <table>

      <tr>
        <td>Player Total: 13, Dealer Card: 5, Usable Ace: true, Action: Hit</td>
        <td>
          The player has a useable ace so their initial hand might have been
          1,2 (an ace and a two). The player total is less than 19 so we hit.

      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>
          We got a 9 and our total is now 17. We had a useable ace that is now not
          useable. This is less than 19 so we hit.

      <tr>

        <td>
          We got a 4 and our total is now 21. BLACKJACK!! Our total is over
          19 so we stick.

        <td>Reward: 0</td>
        <td>Dealer matched our score. A tie.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      For each state encountered (first four rows) we are going to update the
      average with the reward we saw at the end of the game.

    <h2>Hit Max Strategy Win Rate and Cumulative Reward</h2>

    <p>
      I ran some simulations on the table above and copied the results when they looked
      like they converged to a value.

      Win rate goes up as you hit less. Cumulative reward peaks at 16 with a value of <strong>9.86</strong>.

    <h2>
      State Action Values
    </h2>

    <p>
      Above we store the average of the all observed rewards for states. We now
      want to store an average for each state action pair. This allows us to make
      a strategy (policy) by selecting the best action for each state. For each
      state we will look at the state action pairs and pick the action that leads
      to the highest expected reward.
    </p>
    <h2>State Action Table</h2>
    <p>
      Here we are going to use "explore starts". Since we are using our policy
      to make decisions about which actions to take, we might not visit some
      parts of the state space. To compensate for this we are going to select 
      random moves and actions from those moves. The we take the action from the
      selected state and continue the episode as before. The observed reward is then
      used to update all the state actions in the episode, as above.
    </p>

    <div>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" id="button_policy_improvement_start">Start</button>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" id="button_policy_improvement_stop">Stop</button>
    </div>

    <table id="table_state_action_values"></table>

    <h2>Optimal Action Per State</h2>
    <p>
      The best action to take in every state. This is generated by looking at the
      table above and picking the action that leads to the best expected reward.
    </p>
    <table id="table_state_best_action"></table>


    <h2>
      Optimal State Action Values
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just like selecting the best action we can also show max expected reward
      given the best action. Like the table above, except not showing the best
      action but showing the best expected value for any action.
    </p>
    <table id="table_state_best_state_action"></table>

    <h2>
      Evaluating The Optimal Policy
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just like we evaluated the policy above, we can use the optimal policy
      that we computed.
    </p>
    <div>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" id="button_start_eval_optimal">Start</button>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" id="button_stop_eval_optimal">Stop</button>
    </div>
    <div id="policy_eval_optimal">
    </div>

    <p>
      The optimal policy has a win rate of 42.92 and a cumulative reward of <strong>18.78</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
      The optimal policy backs up that sticking is best in most situations which
      we saw above with the fixed hit max strategies. However there is nuance on
      if you have a useable ace. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases explore starts is not an option since the state space
      is too large to be able to visit all states. The next article will
      look at strategies that can be used instead that balance exploration
      and exploitation.
